## Overview👋🏾

Welcome to the 8<sup>th</sup> mini-project of the course!

### The project😥

In this project users will be able to:

- Build a form that displays wave animation.

## My process💭

This is a simple project that I started by creating the form's HTML and marking out initial classes to be later used for styling. Next I began styling the css by styling the form and button. I then added the wave functionality by way of JavaScript targeting each character in the labels and adding transitions.

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

I learned the logic behind making a wave transition by way of utilizing the cubic-bezier timing function. I will be applying this to future projects where needed. See below for [links](#links) that offer more details.

### Continued development🔮

In the future I plan on continuing to practice positioning elements using flexbox, and using different selectors to select elements.

I also plan on continuing to practice using HTMLElement properties to select properties to manipulate in JavaScript.

I also plan on continuing to learn the best ways to phrase git commits, so that future viewers can fully understand the changes that have occurred.

### I'm really proud of these code snippets✂️

```css
.form-control label span {
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 18px;
  min-width: 5px;
  /* cubic-bezier defines a curve, takes in 4 points (p0 p1 p2 & p3), p0 & p3 are the start and the end of the curve respectively */
  transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);
}

.form-control input:focus + label span,
.form-control input:valid + label span {
  color: lightblue;
  /* moves up on the y-axis (negative is up, positive is down) */
  transform: translateY(-30px);
}
```

```js
labels.forEach(label => {
  // targets the characters of labels individually & sets that to the innerHTML
  label.innerHTML = label.innerText
    // splits the innerText (each letter) into an array
    .split('')
    // creates a new array & adds the wave transition delay to each letter via the index
    .map((letter, index) => `<span style="transition-delay:${index * 50}ms">${letter}</span>`)
    // turns the array back into a string
    .join('')
})
```

### Useful resources📖

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bezier_curve) - This article simply defines what a Bezier Curve is. I would recommend this to anyone researching curves and vectors in computer graphics or animation.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function#the_cubic-bezier()_class_of_timing_functions) - This is a resource that explains the cubic-bezier timing function. This was very useful in understanding this concept as it was new to me
- [Resource 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) - This is an amazing resource which lists and describes each HTMLElement.
- [Resource 4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) - This is an amazing article which helped me write better commit messages. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
